Meet Jack. Jack is a 12 year old boy who loves to play video games and is a massive Star Wars fan. While surfing the web, he discovers an incredible free game that allows him to play out his dream of being space pilot. Jack notices that he can pick between two spaceships: the iconic Millennium Falcon and the sleek X-Wing. After choosing the Millennium Falcon and clicking "START WARS", Jack uses the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard to maneuver his spaceship and tries to stay inside the moving hyperspace vortex.

Jack can't wait to compete with his friends and see who can last for the longest amount of time.
